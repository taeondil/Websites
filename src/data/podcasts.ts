Ruby the Rabbit and the Magic Song

Once upon a time, in a sunny forest, there lived a little gray rabbit named Ruby. Ruby loved hopping through the fields, chasing butterflies, and playing hide-and-seek with her brother, Benny. But every evening, when the nightingale sang her magical songs, Ruby sat quietly and listened. "I wish I could sing like her," she thought.  

One morning, Ruby met her friend Squirrel near the old oak tree.  
"Squirrel, I want to sing! But my voice is too small," said Ruby sadly.  
Squirrel twitched her tail. "Your hops are magical, Ruby! You’re the fastest in the forest!"  

Ruby sighed. "But singing is better," she whispered.  

That afternoon, Ruby visited the nightingale’s tree.  
"Dear Nightingale, please teach me to sing," she begged.  
The nightingale smiled. "Sing with your heart, little one!"  
Ruby took a deep breath and sang, "La-la-la!" But her voice was soft, like a breeze. The nightingale said kindly, "Your song is sweet, but maybe your magic is different."  

The next day, Ruby and Benny played near the river. Benny saw a shiny rock across the stream. "I’ll get it!" he said, jumping onto a slippery stone. Oh no! Benny fell into the water! "Help!" he cried. Ruby’s heart raced. She hopped faster than ever, pulling Benny out with her strong paws.  
"Thank you, Ruby!" Benny shivered.  
The animals gathered around. "Ruby saved Benny!" they cheered.  
Squirrel laughed. "See? Your speed is your superpower!"  
The nightingale sang from above: "Every creature has their own song. Yours is the song of courage!"  

Ruby felt proud but still wondered, "What if I try one more time?"  

One windy day, a little deer named Luna got lost in the forest. "I can’t find my mom!" she cried. The animals searched, but the forest was big. Ruby had an idea. "I’ll hop to the high hill and look!" She raced up the hill, her legs moving like lightning. From the top, she saw Luna’s mom near the purple flowers!  
"Follow me, Luna!" Ruby guided the deer safely.  
Luna’s mom nuzzled Ruby. "Thank you, brave rabbit!"  

That night, the animals had a party under the moon. The nightingale sang, and even Ruby danced with joy. "I don’t need to sing," she said. "My hops make the forest happy!"  

Suddenly, the sky darkened. A storm came! The wind blew hard, and rain poured down. "Everyone, hide in the burrow!" Ruby shouted. She quickly led the smaller animals to safety, hopping back and forth to make sure no one was left behind.  
"Ruby, you’re our hero!" said Benny, hugging her.  
The nightingale sang softly: "Your heart and speed are your true song, Ruby."
